# ProductInterviewSystem

Interview system created in basis of a code sample provided. Though it was intended to work with Drinks I decided to create a system that can escalate in case the business require to work with more kind of products.

## Installation

1. Please use Visual Studio Community 2022 or other compatible with .NET Core.
2. Once Solution is opened, configure to run multiple projects, we will need InterviewSystem.API and InterviewSystem.Client set to start up( since it involves an API and Console application to consume services, we need both running )

## Usage

1. Once the project is set up then run using your IDE.
2. You can follow console app instructions for app functions.
